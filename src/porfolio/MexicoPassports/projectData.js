                          streamline the process, but they needed to know more about users’ current experiences, as well \
                          as what they wanted from the bot.",
                          "When the Mexican government sought to design a new experience to help citizens renew their passports, \
                          they connected with the University of Washington’s Human Centered Design and Engineering program. \
                          When our team joined the effort, the government had prototyped a simple bot that could schedule in-person \
                          appointments for passport renewal, but they wanted to understand how they could use the bot to make the \
                          entire passport renewal process more efficient and seamless. To that end, our team decided to apply a \
                          human-centered design approach to conduct research about users and make design recommendations to refine \
                          the existing bot experience"],
